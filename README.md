# Polyrhythm-Visualizer
An html / js site for breaking down complex polyrhythms into practice-able chunks

# Instructions
By indicating the ratio of the two rhythms and how they should be grouped, musicians can get a better feel for how to play these complex polyrhythms and how to group the beats in their head.

For example, a simple 3 against 4 could be input as Rhythm 1: 3 and Rhythm 2: 4 with a grouping of 3. The output visually displays the "PASS the BREAD and BUTter" mnemonic typically taught to memorize this rhythm. More complex rhythms like 7:11 with a grouping of 2 work perfectly fine as well.

Happy jamming!
